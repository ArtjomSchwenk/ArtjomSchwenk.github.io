      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Images by Jan Michalko for the Matrix.org Foundation, CC BY-SA 4.0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From September 19th to 22nd of this year the Matrix.org Foundation held their first own Matrix Conference in person here in Berlin. I initially found out about this, whilst scrolling through their website to learn more about the state of the project. At first I was just interested in attending the talks and to network, but then I saw that they were searching for volunteers to help them out. Now given that I&amp;rsquo;m a university student in Berlin, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t donate much to FOSS-Projects like Matrix, but I still wanted to support them. So I took my chance and volunteered as tribute from district 12.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
